# Agora

### Description
Agora is a discussion forum. Users can post any topic that interests them--a question they have been pondering, an article that they've read, etc. Those topics then become discussion threads, where other users can follow along with the conversation and post replies if they are logged in.

### Set up

2. Run the app: `meteor`
